      <li>1 cup cooked and finely grated ube (purple yam)</li>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>7 egg yolks, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>½ cup corn syrup</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>7 egg whites</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>6 drops red food coloring</li>
      <li>6 drops blue food coloring</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) jar macapuno (coconut preserves)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Buttercream:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup evaporated milk, chilled</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
      <li>1 drop violet food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line the bottoms of three
        9-inch round pans with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Ube Cake:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together
        flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another bowl, combine
        grated ube with ¾ cup milk and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth. Add
        egg yolks, corn syrup, and oil to the ube mixture. Gradually fold in the
        dry ingredients until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy.
        Gradually add sugar, then red and blue food coloring, beating until
        stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the ube batter in
        three batches until no streaks remain. Divide the batter evenly among
        the prepared pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean. Cool cakes completely in pans on a wire rack, then
        invert and remove. Spread a layer of macapuno preserves between each
        cake layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Buttercream:</strong> Combine evaporated milk and sugar
        in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat until sugar dissolves, then set
        aside to cool slightly. Cream together softened butter and sugar until
        light and fluffy. Beat in food coloring until desired shade is reached.
        Frost the entire cake with buttercream.
